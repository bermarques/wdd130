      <p>
        Hello! My name is Bernardo and the third of four children and served as
        a missionary in Fortaleza East mission. I'm looking to upgrade my skills
        and currently work as a front end developer in a company called
        Controlle. I am from Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil and I love practicing
        sports and learning new things, and like to spend my free time playing
        videogames. My current hobbies are playing soccer once a week and
        training boxing a few times a week.
